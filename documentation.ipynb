    "### Definition and Methods in this part\n",
    "Please read through this before step into plots.\n",
    "- **Cumulative Heatmap**\n",
    "We introduce this definition due to the limitation of data collection. The raw heatmap matrix we get from the API is scaled based on the density of that time interval. Therefore, given any non-empty heatmap matrix, the highest density component of that matrix is always 1. Therefore, if we want to compare density heatmaps of two discrete time periods (such as event days and Sundays), we cannot just sum them up.   <br>(For example, $[[1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 0.5]]$ and $[[1, 2, 0.1], [1, 3, 0.3]]$, its cumulation should not just be $[[1, 2, 1.1 (1 + 0.1)], [1, 3, 0.8 (0.5 + 0.3)]]$).<br>However, If we want to compare two discrete time periods, it will be meaningless to compare individual days seperately. <br> (For example, as we find in the previous part, the heatmap on a single event day cannot represent the trend for all event days.)<br> Therefore, it would be better if we have a way to approximate the heatmap for discrete time periods in a more accurate way. In order to achieve this, we need to weight heatmaps of different time periods differently. According to the construction of heatmap provided by the Sidewalk lab, we find that density on a point is essentially a \"dwell count\" data on that point, but scaled between 0 and 1.<br> Therefore, if we weight density for a given time period based on the dwell count of that time period in that given region, we could get a better approximation when sum up heatmap matrix of discrete time periods. <br> (For example, since for all event days, 6.29 has the highest dwell count, its heatmap will be weighted more.) <br> And for the previous example, if $[[1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 0.5]]$ has dwell count 2, while $[[1, 2, 0.1], [1, 3, 0.3]]$ has dwell count 20 with respect to its time periods, then our cumulative heatmap shoule look like $[[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 7]]$ where $3 = 1*2 +0.1* 20, 7 = 0.5*2 + 3*20$. Then we can sclae them again.<br>\n",
    "**Definition** Let $M1$ and $M2$ be two density heatmap matrix for a given zone, with different time periods $t1$ and $t2$, their dwell count, its dwell count is $c1$ and $c2$. $M1 = [[x1, y1, d1], [x2, y2, d2] ...], M1 = [[x1, y1, e1], [x2, y2, e2] ...]$.<br> \n",
    "Then culumative heatmap of $M1$ and $M2$ is $M_c = [[x1, y1, d1*c1+e1*c2], [x2, y2, d2*c1+e2*c2]...]$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantiled Heatmap**\n",
    "We introduce this method due to the limitation of data visualization. According to previous explanantion, if there is a continous line with mostly high density points on the heatmap, we say that line is a desired line for pedestrian's movement, however, only from the data, we cannot see a clear line or a cluser of desired points directly because of the interuption of low density points. Therefore, we may want to drop those low density points based on the percentile(quantile) because they are useless for our analysis, and we may have a better visualization. Also, after we plotting Cumulative Heatmap, there may be many points with extreme low density, they can be considered as outliners, we could drop them for the benefit of data analysis."
