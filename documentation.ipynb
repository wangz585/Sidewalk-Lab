    "This plot is a calendar heatmap that shows maintenance schedule by pedestrian count or dwell time, based on the `metric` selected by the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "We define our metrics as such:  \n",
    "`Pedestrian count`: We choose the maximum hourly pedestrian count as a metric for people, as the total daily pedestrian count may be an overestimate because people would exit and re-enter the area within the same day.   \n",
    "`Dwell time`: We multiply the pedestrian count by mean dwell time to get total dwell time of each day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The user can select a `threshold`, and the default is set as 500. The maintenance schedule is planned as such: First we would check if it is a busy day with pedestrian count or dwell time more than the threshold. If so, an extra maintenance would be schedule on that day; otherwise, this number is added to the number of unmaintained visitors or hours. When the unmaintained number exceeds the threshold, a regular maintenance would be scheduled. Every time a maintenace is scheduled, the unmaintained number clears to zero. "
